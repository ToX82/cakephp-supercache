# CakePHP-Supercache

(almost) drop-in cahing engine for CakePHP I got the idea by a fantastic plugin by Matt Curry (https://github.com/mcurry/html_cache), but I wanted it to be even simpler to implement.


## INSTALLATION STEPS:
* create a new folder called "cache" in your app/webroot directory, with write permissions
* rename app/webroot/index.php to app/webroot/index_cake.php
* save this file to app/webroot. Yes, you're replacing the original file with this one
* that's all folks!
